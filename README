GCZCSE (Globular Cluster Metallicity Clumpy Self-Enrichment)
by Jeremy Bailin (jbailin@ua.edu)
Described in Bailin (2018, ApJ, submitted)

(written in Python2.7)

Usage: python plotter.py [configfile]

configfile is an optional YAML-formatted configuration file. See defaultconfig.cfg
to see what it should look like. Parameters are described in param-description.txt.

plotter.py has a number of flags at the beginning that you might want to change.
Storing the objects turns off parallelization, so if you don't need them (for example,
for plotting MDFs), set obj_flag to False.

If you are generating MDFs and/or want to highlight certain model points on the plots,
object_indices is a set of indices into the logmass array of GMC masses. You can also
change logmass if you want a different set of GMC masses (for example, for testing)...
note that it tends to get very slow above a few 1e7 solar masses.

Aside from the plots, the code will generate a ..._clusters.dat file with the cluster
data. The output/fiducial_clusters.dat is the data from the fiducial run in the paper.


Support for program HST-AR-13908.001-A was provided by NASA through a grant from the
