Gas cloud pre-enrichment.
pre_enrich_level:	Metal pre-enrichment level, in log Z/Z_sun

For clumping, the number of clumps scales with GMC mass as N_clump = N_clumpref (M_GMC/M_GMCref)^s
s:		scaling exponent for number of clumps. s=0 means N_clump is constant, s=1 means M_clump is constant.
Nclumpref:	number of clumps when M_GMC == M_GMCref
MGMCref:	reference cloud mass for clump normalization
Nclump_poisson:	true if Nclump should be drawn from a Poisson distribution with the appropriate
		mean, false if it should be exactly the number given by the formula
clumpy_massfrac:	Fraction of the initial cloud mass that fragments into clumps (i.e.
			f_DG in Lada et al. 2012). The rest
			is diffuse gas. Note that this cannot be less than fstar, which is the total
			fraction of the GMC mass that turns into stars!

The distribution of clump masses is given by a lognormal distribution.
Mclump_dispersion:	width of the underlying normal distribution of the natural log of the clump mass.
			For Mclump_dispersion << 1, this is equal to the fractional dispersion.

The distribution of formation times of clumps within a cloud is a normal distribution.
tform_dispersion:	width of the distribution of formation times of clumps within a cloud, in years.


Stellar lifetimes as a function of mass can be from a simple analytic scaling, or from stellar evolution models.
stellar_lifetimes:	'analytic' = 1e10 M^(-2.5)
			'mist' = interpolation of MIST lifetimes from Choi et al. (2016) data
			'polyfit' = 3rd-degree polynomial fit to MIST lifetimes, accurate to 12% above 0.6 Msun
				(age < 40 Gyr)



IMF parameters for truncated Salpeter
imf_type:		'salpeter': truncated Salpeter
imf_salpeter_mmin:	minimum mass of truncated Salpeter
imf_salpeter_mmax:	maximum mass of truncated Salpeter
imf_salpeter_slope:	slope of truncated Salpeter in dN/dM (should be -2.35)

ESN:			Energy per supernova in ergs

fstar:			Star formation efficiency (fraction of gas turned into stars)

cross_enrichment:	true/false

What determines the clump radius and how does it scale?
clumprad_type:		'cloud_fraction'=a constant fraction of the cloud radius
				Uses the clumprad_fraction parameter
			'constant_density'=scale with clump mass so density is constant
				Uses the clumprad_density parameter
			'constant_surface_density'=scale with clump mass so surface density is constant
				(a la Larson's relation).
				Uses the clumprad_surface_density parameter
The parameters are
clumprad_density:	density of each clump, in solar masses per cubic parsec
clumprad_fraction:	each clump's radius is clumprad_fraction times the radius of the parent cloud
clumprad_surface_density:	surface density of each clump, in solar masses per square pc


The degree to which supernova ejecta is mixes with the surrounding intraclump/
intracloud medium and entrains it in any flows out the clump/cloud.
mixing_efficiency:      Interpolates between the ejected mass being entirely from SN
						ejecta (for 0) to being a fully mixed representative of the
						cluster (for 1).


Enrichment and energy feedback mechanisms are specified with a sublist.
enrichment_mechanisms:		List of processes that eject metals.
feedback_mechanisms:		List of processes that eject energy.
			Possible mechanisms:
				'CCSN' or 'supernovae': core collapse supernovae.

Core collapse supernova yields.
ccsn_yield: 'bh09' = parametrization from Bailin & Harris (2009)
            'nugrid' = BH09 below 15 Msun, interpolated yields for solar nuGrid
                        models at 15 < M < 60, same yield fraction as 60 Msun model
                        at higher masses.
            'westheger' = BH09 below 13 Msun, interpolated yields for [Z/H]=-1.5
                        Cote models at 13 < M < 30, zero yield at higher masses.
            'nomoto13' = BH09 below 10 Msun, interpolated yields for [Z/H]=-1.2 
            			Nomoto et al. (2013) models at 10 < M < 40, same yield fraction
            			as 40 Msun model at higher masses.
